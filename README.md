# Adapter Requests
This Place is used to track the status of Requests for new ioBroker-Adapters.

**Issues and problems with existing Adapters should be created as issues in the respective Adapter Repository.**

## How to use this?
* If you are interested in a new Adater for a new device or functionality then please create a new Issue (see below for information)
* If an issue is already existing use the "+1"/"Thumbs up" button to also show interest/vote for the topic

## Why should I vote for issues?
... because the developers use this as information too see which Adapter is interesting for how many users ... but this is only one reason a developer starts development. So also less voted adapter requests could be done before others. It is still a decision from the developer!

## What information the issue should contain?
* The issue name should clearly contain the device or functionality
* In the issue description provide all information you was able to collect so far. Please include links to the manufactorer with information, datasheets, developer documentation, API specs
* If the topic was discussed in ioBroker forum please include the link too.
* Vote for yourself in the first post of the issue using the "+1"/"Thumbs up" button

## How developers should use it?
* If you want to develop a new Adapter please add your own ideas and adapters here too seo that we have transparency (as it was in Trello partly before)
* Assign the issue to yourself to show that you are working on it and also use the Labels
* CLose the issue when the adapter or functionality is available
